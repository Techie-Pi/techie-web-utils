## Supported Versions

The latest version of each major version is supported until a new major is released, this will be notified with a deprecation notice in the latest version of any major one.

Examples:
- There are two versions: the version ``2.0.0`` and the version ``2.1.0``: The version ``2.0.0`` is not supported, but ``2.0.0`` is
- There are two versions: the version ``2.8.18`` and the version ``3.0.0``: The version ``2.8.18`` is not supported, but ``3.0.0`` is

Right now the schema is as follows:

|  Version | Supported          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| >= 1.1.0 | :white_check_mark: |
| <= 1.0.0 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability you should just create an issue, I'll solve it as soon as possible. If you think it should be private, create the issue (but empty) and email me to ``techiepi@pm.me``.
There isn't any specific vulnerability reward program, but I'll try to reward you in any way I can (although I can't promise anything -but I'll try-)

## Additional notes

Any question or suggestion about this policy is accepted and I'll be pleased to check it
